title: Solo's ArcDps - Healing-Stats addon Guide
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

!!How to set up ArcDPS Heal Addon:

# Download the Addon dll file here: [[ArcDps Healing-Stats Addon|https://github.com/Krappa322/arcdps_healing_stats/releases]]
# Move the dll file to the same file as your ArcDPS dll file.
# Open ArcDPS in game `Alt+Shift+T` and go to the Extensions tab.
# Select "healing_stats" and at the bottom make sure to check "log healing to EVTC logs" and "enable live stat sharing."

!!For clean and easy to read Healing Addon visuals:

#Check `(5) Healing`.
# Right click on the Healing window. For data source select `peers outgoing`. For sort order select `heal per second descending`. For combat end select `last damage/heal event`.
# Under the Display settings put 5 for max displayed. If more than 5 people are running the Addon you can scroll down to see below the top 5.
# For stats format use `{1} ({4}/s)`. This will display overall healing followed by healing per second in parenthesis.
# Under Style select `auto resize window`.
